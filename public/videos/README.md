# Video Setup Instructions

## Problem
External video hosting services (Pexels, Mixkit, etc.) block hotlinking, causing videos to fail with 403 errors.

## Solution
Host videos locally in your project.

## Steps to Add Your Video

### 1. Download a Video
Download a professional real estate/office video from:
- **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/office%20building/
- **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/videos/search/office/
- **Videvo**: https://www.videvo.net/

**Recommended specs:**
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- Duration: 15-30 seconds
- Format: MP4
- File size: Under 10MB for fast loading

### 2. Save the Video
Save your downloaded video file as:
```
public/videos/homepage-hero.mp4
```

### 3. Video is Already Configured
The code is already set up to use `/videos/homepage-hero.mp4`

### 4. Test
Refresh your browser and the video should play!

## Alternative: Use a Solid Color Background
If you prefer not to use a video, you can use a solid color or gradient background instead. Let me know if you'd like me to implement that option.

## Custom Video Creation
For your custom Kurukshetra office video (as per your detailed prompt), you can:
1. Get it created on Fiverr/Upwork
2. Save it as `homepage-hero.mp4` in the `public/videos` folder
3. It will automatically work!
